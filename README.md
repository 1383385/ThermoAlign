ThermoAlign:
================================================
ThermoAlign is a a genome-aware oligonucleotide design algorithm embedded within a distributable tool (i.e. consolidating analysis of thermodynamics and sequence alignment). ThermoAlign determines the priming specificity of oligonucleotides based on genome-wide analysis of the thermodynamics of hybridization for full-length and relevant primer-template interactions in the presence of mismatches, to design and select template specific oligonucleotides for any species with a reference genome sequence. It is also capable of using prior information on genomic variants during the selection of candidate oligonucleotides. In addition to the design of primer pairs for standard, single locus PCR amplification, ThermoAlign uses a directed graph analysis approach to design multiplex sets of tiled primer pairs for targeted sequencing of large segments of a genome.
